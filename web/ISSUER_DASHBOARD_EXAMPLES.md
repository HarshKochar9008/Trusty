# Issuer Dashboard - Example Details & Usage Guide

## üìã **Dashboard Overview**

The Issuer Dashboard allows healthcare providers to create and issue health records on the Hedera blockchain with sustainability tracking and SDG goal alignment.

> **üöÄ Real Blockchain Integration**: When you have `OPERATOR_ID`, `OPERATOR_KEY`, and `HEDERA_TOPIC_ID` configured in your `.env.local` file, the system will automatically submit real transactions to the Hedera testnet and generate actual HashScan URLs that you can verify on the blockchain.
